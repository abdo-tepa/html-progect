                Although the use of AI remains relatively low across organizations, statistics show that an increasing number of enterprises are starting to employ it within their business operations.

In 2015, just ten percent of organizations reported that they either already used artificial intelligence technology or would be doing so in the near future. Fast forward to 2019 and that number rose to 37 percent, which means that more than one in three organizations are either using artificial intelligence or have plans to do so (Gartner, 2019).

This represents an impressive 270 percent growth in just four years. Most of this growth came from 2018 to 2019, during which the usage of AI within organizations as much as tripled.

In fact, it’s clear that organizations are starting to pay more and more attention to the power of artificial intelligence. It’s been named the most disruptive technology by chief intelligence officers and IT leaders worldwide, surpassing data and analytics.

                With the growing implementation of artificial intelligence among organizations, it should come as no surprise that the market size of AI is set to increase dramatically.

The latest data shows that the market size of artificial intelligence was valued at $27.23 billion in 2019 (Fortune Business Insights, 2020). This figure is projected to reach $266.92 billion by 2027—a nearly tenfold increase in just eight years and with a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 33.2 percent.

One of the driving forces behind this impressive artificial intelligence growth is expected to come from businesses adopting it to power customer engagement. More and more, companies are relying on AI to provide customers with more personalized services. Coupled with the growing emphasis on customer services, implementation of AI to serve customers will only increase.

According to industry analysts, healthcare will be one of the biggest sectors to benefit from the applications of AI. This is particularly so during the coronavirus pandemic, during which artificial intelligence can provide more accurate diagnoses and in turn, more efficient treatments
